# AWS Signature 4 Auth Dynamic Value (Paw Extension)

A [Paw Extension](http://luckymarmot.com/paw/extensions/) to compute
AWS Signature version 4 authentication signatures for the accessing the
main AWS services including REST APIs build using AWS API Gateway that are
protected using IAM.

## Installation

TBD

To support AWS Signature 4 authentication please follow these steps:

* Install this extension. For now, you should install by using the Makefile
    (see Development section below).
* Add a header `Authorization` and set the value to this extension (start
    typing "AWS" and select AWS Signature 4).
* Enter your credentials by clicking on the dynamic value extension.
    The AWS Access and Secret keys are required. If you
    leave the other fields blank they will use defaults.
* Add a second header `X-Amz-Date`. Set the value to custom timestamp (start
    typing "timestamp" and select any of the timestamp options).
* Enter a custom timestamp format by clicking on the dynamic value extension,
    and selecting `Custom formatting` from the format. Enter the value
    `%G%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for the format. Make sure `Now` is checked, delta is 0,
    and `local time` is unchecked. AWS requires the time be within a few seconds
    of server time in UTC (not local time).

If you don't have something to test against, follow the [Getting Started][start]
guide for the API Gateway service to create a basic "hello world" API. Make sure
that the API is [protected by IAM security][protect] by choosing "authorization type"
of `AWS IAM` in the console when configuring the method.

This extension is being developed primarily to test in-house API Gateway REST
APIs. However, AWS Signature 4 is used to protect all of the standard AWS
service endpoints. By ensuring you have the correct `aws service` setting
for the extension you can manually call any of the AWS service endpoints using
Paw.

> Note: if you are a user of STS temporary credentials, you will also need a header `X-Amz-Security-Token` with your `session token`.

# Issues

* Freeze dynamic values to obtain X-Amz-Date as generated and sent to client
* Need binary version of HMAC SHA256 crypto function. Currently using CryptJS
  which is fairly slow.

## Development

Edit source javascript file and run the following to install in Paw.

```shell
make install
```
